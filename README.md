Linguistic Type Data-Base

The Linguistic Type Database (LTDB, n√©e Lextype DB), describes types
and rules of a DELPH-IN grammar with frequency information from the
treebank. Lexical types can be seen as detailed parts-of-speech.
Information about the types are constructed from the linguists
documentation in the grammar, a kind of literate programming.

There is [more documentation](http://moin.delph-in.net/LkbLtdb) at the DELPH-IN Wiki.

## Usage

1. Run `./make-ltdb.bash --grmdir /path/to/grammar`

```bash
./make-ltdb.bash --grmdir ~/logon/dfki/jacy
```

Everything is installed to `~/public_html/`

## Installation

### Requirements
```
  * Perl
  * SQLite3
  * Apache
  * LKB/Lisp		for db dump
  * xmlstarlet		for validating lisp
  * python 2.7, python 3, pydelphin, docutils

  * jquery, jquery tablesorter (patched)
``` 

We prefer that Sentence IDs are unique, if we see two sentences in the
gold treebank with the same ID, we only store the first one.


Install dependencies (in ubuntu):
```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2 xmlstarlet

sudo pip install pydelphin
sudo pip install docutils
```


### Enable local directories in Apache2:


```bash
sudo a2enmod userdir
sudo a2enmod cgi
```




Put this in /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```xml
<Directory /home/*/public_html/cgi-bin/>
   Options +ExecCGI
   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
</Directory>
```

And then restart Apache2
```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

## Todo

 * check I am getting lrule/irule right
